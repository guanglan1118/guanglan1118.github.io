## About Me

I am a **computational cancer genomics and pharmacogenomics researcher** with 8+ years of research experience spanning microbiology, oncology, and precision medicine.

My work focuses on **multi-omics data integration (RNA-seq / WES / WGS)** and **drug response profiling** to identify biomarkers and mechanisms underlying therapeutic sensitivity and resistance in cancer, particularly **pediatric acute leukemia**.

I am currently transitioning fully into **computational and data-driven biomedical research**, with an emphasis on reproducible analysis pipelines and translational precision oncology.
